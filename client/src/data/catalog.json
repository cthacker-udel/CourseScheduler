In this course we identify, examine, and explore dominant narratives about motherhood and reproduction from cross-cultural perspectives, and the personal stakes and political scales at which different experiences of motherhood impact. We focus specifically on motherhood since it is the relationship between mother and child that is predominantly politicized in various configurations of power both historically and contemporaneously, although we do examine topics related to parenthood more broadly. Through the study of ethnographic research, we look critically and cross-culturally at topics related to: contraception, family planning, fertility, pregnancy, birth, early childhood, motherhood, parenthood, child welfare interventions, media and popular cultural representations of motherhood, and labor and work, especially as these topics intersect with concerns related to nationhood, gender, sexuality, racism, class, socio-economic status, religion, politics, ethnicity, and cultural background.",

Humanitarianism claims that all humans have the same right to care and protection, yet in reality human life continues to be unfairly stratified according to race, sexuality, gender, and ability: something that humanitarianism does not automatically solve. In this class, we dig deep into the ways that politics and social position frames humanitarian encounters, and we will particularly focus on the ways that people within groups who receive these interventions-particularly in continental Africa, or in situations of forced migration-themselves perceive and experience them. We go beyond the spectacle of celebrity humanitarianism, and consider instead the historical and cultural specificity of humanitarianism, and the politics of life and death.",

The second half of the semester details the historical creation and oversight of policies related to federal agencies toward wildlife and wildlife habitat in the face of a growing and changing society. While the second half provides an overview of many policies, it also uses lengthier case studies to detail the interaction of human dimensions with wildlife conservation. Because wildlife and fisheries management in the 21st century has as much to do with human dimensions, economics and equity, social politics, and environmental policy, as it does ecology principles; this course is designed to prepare students to succeed as wildlife and natural resource professionals.",

The second half of the semester details the historical creation and oversight of policies related to federal agencies toward wildlife and wildlife habitat in the face of a growing and changing society. While the second half provides an overview of many policies, it also uses lengthier case studies to detail the interaction of human dimensions with wildlife conservation. Because wildlife and fisheries management in the 21<supst</sup century has as much to do with human dimensions, economics and equity, social politics, and environmental policy, as it does ecology principles; this course is designed to prepare students to succeed as wildlife and natural resource professionals.",

Once it was clearly established as an instrument for conveying and enforcing civilization and superiority violence soon took on a more direct and varied role in the mission civilsatrice. The acts became ever more specific with destruction of cultural memory and the humiliation of the victims and their material culture increasingly common. In time, the oppressed came to rely on violence as a weapon to strike back at (and communicate with) their enemies. Indeed, these very exchanges make it clear how well the texts of violence were understood by both sides of the conflict. Finally, the terror and violence too familiar in our own day will form a final few weeks of reading and discussion to try to understand how violence is used today as a weapon by both the weak and the very strongest.",

Humanitarianism claims that all humans have the same right to care and protection, yet in reality human life continues to be unfairly stratified according to race, sexuality, gender, and ability: something that humanitarianism does not automatically solve. In this class, we dig deep into the ways that politics and social position frames humanitarian encounters, and we will particularly focus on the ways that people within groups who receive these interventions-particularly in continental Africa, or in situations of forced migration-themselves perceive and experience them. We go beyond the spectacle of celebrity humanitarianism, and consider instead the historical and cultural specificity of humanitarianism, and the politics of life and death.",

We focus specifically on motherhood since it is the relationship between mother and child that is predominantly politicized in various configurations of power both historically and contemporaneously, although we do examine topics related to parenthood more broadly. Through the study of ethnographic research, we look critically and cross-culturally at topics related to: contraception, family planning, fertility, pregnancy, birth, early childhood, motherhood, parenthood, child welfare interventions, media and popular cultural representations of motherhood, and labor and work, especially as these topics intersect with concerns related to nationhood, gender, sexuality, racism, class, socio-economic status, religion, politics, ethnicity, and cultural background.",

    "credits": "3",
    "description": "This course explores the politics, ethics, and dimensions of cultural diversity that are embedded in situations of global humanitarianism-but often ignored, through claims of the supposed 'neutrality' of humanitarian intervention. Humanitarianism claims that all humans have the same right to care and protection, yet in reality human life continues to be unfairly stratified according to race, sexuality, gender, and ability: something that humanitarianism does not automatically solve. In this class, we dig deep into the ways that politics and social position frames humanitarian encounters, and we will particularly focus on the ways that people within groups who receive these interventions-particularly in continental Africa, or in situations of forced migration-themselves perceive and experience them. We go beyond the spectacle of celebrity humanitarianism, and consider instead the historical and cultural specificity of humanitarianism, and the politics of life and death.",
